## Architecture Overview

The SolidFed client is part of a larger federated learning ecosystem with the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Client Application** - This command-line tool that enables users to participate in federated learning
2. **Solid Pod Storage** - Decentralized storage infrastructure that hosts data and model files
3. **Server Orchestrator** - Central service that manages model registration and updates
4. **Training Engine** - Python-based local training environment that runs on the client's machine

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Data Sovereignty**: Local data never leaves the user's device; only model updates are shared
- **Privacy Preservation**: Differential privacy mechanisms protect against data extraction
- **Decentralized Storage**: All shared model files are hosted on Solid Pods rather than centralized servers
- **Asynchronous Updates**: Clients can contribute to the global model at any time
- **Flexible Integration**: Support for various ML frameworks and training algorithms

## Dataflow Overview

The client participates in federated learning through these dataflow steps:

1. **Authentication and Registration**
   ```
   Client --> Solid Pod: Authenticate using client credentials
   Client --> Server: Register for model access
   Server --> Solid Pod: Configure permissions for client
   Server --> Client: Return model URL
   ```

2. **Model and Data Acquisition**
   ```
   Client --> Solid Pod: Fetch current global model
   Client --> Local Storage: Download training data (optional)
   Client --> Local Storage: Save model and trainer script
   ```

3. **Local Training**
   ```
   Client: Execute training script on local data
   Client: Generate model update
   Client: Apply differential privacy (optional)
   ```

4. **Model Contribution**
   ```
   Client --> Server: Upload model update
   Server --> Solid Pod: Integrate update with global model
   Server --> Client: Confirm successful contribution
   ```

## Prerequisites

* **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
* **npm** (v6 or higher)
* **Python** (v3.6 or higher) for running the training scripts
* **A Solid Pod** (e.g., on [SolidCommunity.net](https://solidcommunity.net/))
* **Client ID & Secret** for your Solid account (authentication details)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manapureanshul7/solidfed.git
   cd solidfed/client
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies for training scripts:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy tensorflow pandas
   ```

4. Make the CLI executable (optional):
   ```bash
   chmod +x cli.js
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the client directory with the following variables:

```dotenv
# Required: Solid Pod authentication details
SOLID_OIDC_ISSUER=https://solidcommunity.net
SOLID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SOLID_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Optional: Pre-configured settings
ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://localhost:4000
SOLIDFED_POD_ROOT=https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/
CLIENT_DATASET_URL=https://yourusername.solidcommunity.net/datasets/
```

### Getting Your Client ID & Secret

To generate your Client ID & Secret on SolidCommunity.net:
1. Go to https://solidcommunity.net/.account/login/password/ and log in
2. Scroll to "Credential tokens" ‚Üí "Create token"
3. Copy the returned "id" as Client ID and "secret" as Client Secret

## Usage

### CLI Interface

Start the SolidFed client CLI with:

```bash
npm start
```

Or directly:

```bash
./cli.js
```

The interactive menu provides the following options:

```
===== SolidFed CLI =====
1. Login to Solid Pod
2. Register for a model
3. Download training data
4. Download model & trainer code
5. Train locally & upload weights
6. How to get your Client ID & Secret
7. Logout
8. Exit
```

### Authentication

**Option 1: Login to Solid Pod**

This authenticates with your Solid Pod using client credentials:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clientId": "your_client_id", "clientSecret": "your_client_secret"}' \
  https://solidcommunity.net/.oidc/token
```

If you've configured your `.env` file, the CLI will use those credentials automatically. Otherwise, you'll be prompted:

```
Enter your Token Identifier: your_client_id
Enter your Token Secret: your_client_secret
```

Upon successful authentication, you'll see:
```
‚úÖ Logged in as https://yourusername.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me
```

### Model Registration

**Option 2: Register for a model**

This connects you to the orchestrator server and requests access to a specific model:

1. Select a model from the list:
   ```
   ===== Select a Model =====
   1. breast-cancer-detection
   2. movie-recommender
   3. dummy-model
   4. Back to main menu
   ```
This are currently statically updated, new functionality is to be added to fetch them directly from the Server's pod.

2. The client registers with the server:
   ```
   Registering for model: test-2...
   ‚úÖ Successfully registered for test-2
   üìÅ Model URL: https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/test-2/
   ```

### Data and Model Management

**Option 3: Download training data**

Download datasets for local training:

```
‚Üì Fetching container: https://yourusername.solidcommunity.net/datasets/
‚Üì Downloading train.csv ‚Üí ./dataset/train.csv
‚úÖ Downloaded 1 file(s) into ./dataset
```

**Option 4: Download model & trainer code**

Fetch the current global model and training script:

```
Downloading model and trainer for: test-2...
‚Üì Fetching globalModel.bin from https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/test-2/
‚úÖ Downloaded globalModel.bin using direct fetch
‚Üì Fetching clientTrainer.py from https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/test-2/
‚úÖ Downloaded clientTrainer.py using direct fetch
```

### Training and Contribution

**Option 5: Train locally & upload weights**

Execute training and contribute your model updates:

```
Running local training...
Executing clientTrainer.py...
Training on local data...
Training complete. Weights saved to localWeights.bin

===== Upload Options =====
1. Upload weights without privacy protection
2. Upload weights with differential privacy
3. View differential privacy explanation
4. Cancel upload
```

If you choose differential privacy:

```
===== Configure Differential Privacy =====
Epsilon (Œµ) - Privacy Budget: 1.0
Delta (Œ¥) - Privacy Failure Probability: 1e-5
L2 Norm Clipping Threshold: 1.0
Approximate Training Dataset Size: 1000

Applying differential privacy with parameters:
  - Epsilon: 1.0
  - Delta: 0.00001
  - L2 Norm Clip: 1.0
  - Sample Rate: 0.001
```

## Privacy Features

The SolidFed client offers built-in differential privacy to protect your training data:

- **Noise Injection**: Adds calibrated Gaussian noise to model updates
- **L2 Norm Clipping**: Limits the influence of any single training example
- **Privacy Budget Management**: Tracks cumulative privacy cost across rounds
- **Privacy-Utility Tradeoff**: Configurable parameters to balance protection and model quality

Configure privacy settings directly in the upload menu:

```
===== Configure Differential Privacy =====
Epsilon (Œµ) - Privacy Budget:
  - Low values (0.1-1.0): High privacy, potentially lower utility
  - Medium values (1.0-5.0): Good privacy-utility tradeoff
  - High values (5.0+): Prioritizes utility over privacy
```

### Using the Client from NodeJS

```javascript
const { loginWithClientCreds } = require('./auth');
const { downloadModelAndTrainer } = require('./download');
const { trainWithDP } = require('./train');

async function runFederatedLearningWorkflow() {
  // 1. Authenticate
  const session = await loginWithClientCreds();
  
  // 2. Register for a model (if not already registered)
  // ... registration code ...
  
  // 3. Download model and trainer
  await downloadModelAndTrainer(session, 'test-2');
  
  // 4. Train with differential privacy
  const dpOptions = {
    epsilon: 1.0,
    delta: 1e-5,
    l2NormClip: 1.0,
    datasetSize: 1000
  };
  
  await trainWithDP(session, 'test-2', dpOptions);
}
```
