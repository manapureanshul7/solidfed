## Prerequisites

Before using the SolidFed Client, you need:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **npm** (v6 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.6 or higher) for running the training scripts
- **A Solid Pod** (e.g., on [SolidCommunity.net](https://solidcommunity.net/))
- **Client ID & Secret** for your Solid account

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solidfed.git
   cd solidfed/client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install Python dependencies for training scripts:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy tensorflow pandas
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the client directory with the following variables:

```
# Required: Your Solid Pod authentication details
SOLID_OIDC_ISSUER=https://solidcommunity.net
SOLID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SOLID_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret

# Optional: Pre-configured settings
ORCHESTRATOR_URL=http://localhost:4000
SOLIDFED_POD_ROOT=https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/
CLIENT_DATASET_URL=https://yourusername.solidcommunity.net/datasets/
```

### Getting Your Client ID & Secret

To generate your Client ID & Secret on SolidCommunity.net:
1. Go to https://solidcommunity.net/.account/login/password/ and log in
2. Scroll to "Credential tokens" ‚Üí "Create token"
3. Copy the returned "id" as Client ID and "secret" as Client Secret

## Usage

The SolidFed client provides a command-line interface (CLI) for all operations. Launch it with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the interactive CLI menu with the following options:

```
===== SolidFed CLI =====
1. Login to Solid Pod
2. Register for a model
3. Download training data
4. Download model & trainer code
5. Train locally & upload weights
6. How to get your Client ID & Secret
7. Logout
8. Exit
```

### Authentication

**Option 1: Login to Solid Pod**

This step authenticates you with your Solid Pod using the client credentials flow.

If you have already configured `SOLID_CLIENT_ID` and `SOLID_CLIENT_SECRET` in your `.env` file, the client will use those credentials. Otherwise, you will be prompted to enter them manually.

```
Enter your Token Identifier: your_client_id
Enter your Token Secret: your_client_secret
```

Upon successful authentication, the CLI will display:
```
‚úÖ Logged in as https://yourusername.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me
```

### Model Registration

**Option 2: Register for a model**

This step connects you to the orchestrator server and requests access to a specific federated learning model. You must be logged in first.

1. Select a model from the list:
   ```
   ===== Select a Model =====
   1. breast-cancer-detection
   2. movie-recommendation
   3. dummy-model
   4. Back to main menu
   ```

2. The client sends a registration request to the server:
   ```
   Registering for model: breast-cancer-detection...
   ```

3. The server creates necessary containers and grants you read permissions:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Successfully registered for breast-cancer-detection
   üìÅ Model URL: https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/breast-cancer-detection/
   ```

The model URL is stored for future operations, allowing direct access to the model files.

### Data Download

**Option 3: Download training data**

This step downloads training datasets for local use. If `CLIENT_DATASET_URL` is set in your `.env` file, it will use that location; otherwise, you will be prompted for a URL.

```
‚Üì Fetching container: https://yourusername.solidcommunity.net/datasets/
‚Üì Downloading train.csv ‚Üí ./dataset/train.csv
‚Üì Downloading test.csv ‚Üí ./dataset/test.csv
‚úÖ Downloaded 2 file(s) into ./dataset
```

### Model Download

**Option 4: Download model & trainer code**

This step downloads the global model and trainer script from the Solid Pod. It uses the model URL obtained during registration.

```
Downloading model and trainer for: breast-cancer-detection...
Using stored model URL: https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/breast-cancer-detection/
‚Üì Fetching globalModel.bin from https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/breast-cancer-detection/
‚úÖ Downloaded globalModel.bin using direct fetch
‚Üì Fetching clientTrainer.py from https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/breast-cancer-detection/
‚úÖ Downloaded clientTrainer.py using direct fetch
‚úÖ Downloaded model and trainer successfully
```

The files are saved to your local directory and can be examined or modified as needed.

### Local Training

**Option 5: Train locally & upload weights**

This step executes the trainer script on your local data and then uploads the resulting weights to contribute to the global model.

1. The client executes the trainer script:
   ```
   Running local training...
   Executing clientTrainer.py...
   Training on local data...
   Training complete. Weights saved to localWeights.bin
   ```

2. Enter the round number when prompted:
   ```
   Federated round number (default: 1): 2
   ```

3. The client uploads your weights to the orchestrator:
   ```
   Uploading weights for model breast-cancer-detection, round 2...
   ‚úÖ Uploaded to https://solidfed.solidcommunity.net/solidfed/breast-cancer-detection/globalModel.bin
   ```

## CLI Commands

The SolidFed client is designed with an interactive menu, but if you prefer direct commands, here's a reference:

- **Login**: `node cli.js login`
- **Register**: `node cli.js register MODEL_NAME`
- **Download data**: `node cli.js download-data [URL]`
- **Download model**: `node cli.js download-model MODEL_NAME`
- **Train**: `node cli.js train MODEL_NAME ROUND`
- **Logout**: `node cli.js logout`

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Issues

If you encounter 403 Forbidden errors when trying to download files:

1. **Check Registration**: Ensure you've successfully registered for the model
2. **Try Direct Fetch**: The client will attempt both direct fetch and library-based methods
3. **Check URLs**: Verify the URLs in the debug output match your expected pod structure
4. **Pod ACLs**: Check permissions on your Solid Pod through its web interface

### Training Errors

If the training script fails:

1. **Check Python Version**: Ensure you're using Python 3.6+
2. **Check Dependencies**: Install required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Data Path**: The trainer expects data in the `./dataset` directory
4. **Model Format**: Ensure `globalModel.bin` is in the correct format (binary NumPy array)

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Training Scripts

You can modify the `clientTrainer.py` script to implement your own training logic:

1. Download the script: `Option 4`
2. Modify the script to change architecture, hyperparameters, etc.
3. Run training with your changes: `Option 5`

The only requirement is that your script should save weights to `localWeights.bin` in the format expected by the server.

### Multiple Models

You can work with multiple models simultaneously:

1. Register for different models: `Option 2`
2. Download each model separately: `Option 4`
3. Train on each model locally
4. Upload weights for each model: `Option 5`

The client will keep track of the current model, which you can see displayed in the main menu.

## Architecture Overview

The SolidFed system follows an asynchronous federated learning approach where:

1. **Server Orchestrator**: Central coordinator that manages registrations and updates
2. **Solid Pods**: Decentralized storage for model files and data
3. **Client CLI**: Interface for users to interact with the system

The workflow consists of:
- Registration: Client requests access to a model
- Download: Client retrieves model files directly from Pods
- Training: Client trains locally on their data
- Upload: Client contributes weights back to the global model

This architecture ensures data sovereignty while enabling collaborative learning across distributed clients.
